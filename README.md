# Moneto_carlo_act

# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo methods to estimate probabilities through random sampling. The simulation leverages Python to approximate mathematical results that are otherwise difficult to compute analytically.
Monte Carlo techniques are widely used in statistics, finance, and scientific computing for modeling uncertainty and randomness.

# Project Objectives

Understand the concept of random sampling and statistical estimation.

Implement Monte Carlo simulations to estimate probabilities.

Visualize the distribution of outcomes and compare them with theoretical expectations.

Learn the practical application of probability and statistics using Python.

# Key Features

Simulation of random experiments using NumPy and SciPy.

Calculation of probability values through iterative random trials.

Estimation of outcomes such as:

Coin toss and dice roll probabilities

Ï€ (Pi) estimation

Probability distribution sampling

Comparison between analytical vs simulated probabilities.

# Technologies Used

Python 3

NumPy â€“ for random number generation and array operations

Matplotlib â€“ for data visualization

SciPy â€“ for probability functions and distributions

ðŸ“Š Example Results

The Monte Carlo method produces an empirical estimate of probabilities that converge closer to theoretical values as the number of trials increases.
For instance:

Estimated value of Ï€ â‰ˆ 3.1416 (after 1,000,000 iterations)

Probability of rolling a 6 on a die â‰ˆ 0.1667

# Learning Outcomes

Improved understanding of probabilistic simulations

Hands-on practice with randomness and convergence

Practical application of Python in mathematical modeling
